All roles in the system belong to and inherit from the *Person* category, including the system administrator, Organization administrator, Enterprise administrator and Customer. Therefore, we use either the registration page or the login page as the system enter page. All users own a *unique ID*, and the same role **can only have a unique name**, but the names can be duplicated between different roles.
